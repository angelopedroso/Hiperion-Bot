## Overview

This repository contains a Node application that implements a bot for managing WhatsApp groups using the [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) library. The bot supports the commands listed below and allows interaction in **English** and **Portuguese**.

> **Note**: This bot will never have a feature to send bulk messages in private to users or groups.
> **Warning**: I am not responsible for the actions of anyone who uses it.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed in your environment:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Separate phone number for exclusive use by the bot
- Google Chrome
- Docker

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Execute the following commands to set up the environment:

   - Install the dependencies using Yarn or another package manager (e.g., npm):

     ```shell
     yarn install
     ```

   - Configure the `.env` file with the necessary information:

     ```plaintext
     BOT_NAME=
     OWNER_NUM=
     BOT_NUM=
     LANGUAGE=

     # SightEngine - https://dashboard.sightengine.com/login
     API_SIGHTENGINE_USER=
     API_SIGHTENGINE_SECRET=

     # OPENAI - https://platform.openai.com
     OPENAI_API_KEY=
     OPENAI_PASSWORD=

     # ACRCLOUD - https://www.acrcloud.com
     ACR_HOST=
     ACR_KEY=
     ACR_SECRET_KEY=

     # DATABASE (mongodb)
     DATABASE_URL=

     # REDIS (optional if using a local Redis)
     REDIS_URI=
     ```

   - Apply the database migrations using Prisma:

     ```shell
     yarn prisma db push
     ```

3. If you prefer to use a Dockerfile, you can build and run the Docker container separately:

   - Build the Docker:

     ```shell
     docker compose up -d
     ```

   - Run the Docker container:

     ```shell
     docker compose start
     ```

   > **Note**: See the bot log to scan qr code at the first time - `docker compose logs bot -f`.

4. To build and start the application without Docker, use the following commands:

   - Build the application:

     ```shell
     yarn build
     ```

   - Start the application:

     ```shell
     yarn start
     ```

   > **Note**: Go to startupConfig on src/config/startupConfig.ts and replace Chrome's path if necessary.
