## Overview

This repository contains a Node application that implements a bot for managing WhatsApp groups using the [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) library. The bot supports the commands listed below and allows interaction in **English** and **Portuguese**.

> **Note**: This bot will never have a feature to send bulk messages in private to users or groups.

> **Warning**: I am not responsible for the actions of anyone who uses it.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed in your environment:

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Separate phone number for exclusive use by the bot
- Google Chrome
- Docker

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Run the following command to install the dependencies using Yarn:

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

3. To run MySQL and Redis in Docker, use Docker Compose. Make sure Docker Compose is installed in your environment.

   - In the root of the project, run the following command:

     ```shell
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   > **Note**: This will start the MySQL and Redis services in Docker, as configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file already in the root of the project.

4. Run the following command to install database model:

   ```shell
   yarn prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. Configure the `.env` file with the necessary information:

   ```plaintext
   BOT_NAME=
   OWNER_NUM=
   BOT_NUM=
   LANGUAGE=

   # SightEngine - https://dashboard.sightengine.com/login
   API_SIGHTENGINE_USER=
   API_SIGHTENGINE_SECRET=

   # OPENAI - https://platform.openai.com
   OPENAI_API_KEY=
   OPENAI_PASSWORD=

   # DATABASE (mysql) Example: "mysql://root:docker@localhost:3306/hiperion"
   DATABASE_URL=

   # REDIS (optional if using a local Redis)
   REDIS_URI=
   ```

   > **Note**: The `.env` file will be automatically generated on the first bot execution. The bot will request a restart after the creation of `.env`.

6. Start the application with the following command:

   ```shell
   yarn start
   ```

> **Note**: Go to startupConfig on src/config/startupConfig.ts and replace chrome's path if necessary.
